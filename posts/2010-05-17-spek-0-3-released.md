Author: Alexander Kojevnikov

[Spek 0.3][] is out, just 2 days after the previous release. This
version includes the following features and fixes:

[![Rulers in Spek][]][]

-   Horizontal (time) and vertical (frequency) rulers, auto-adjustable
    to the duration and sample rate of the audio file and to the window
    size.
-   First take on the command line arguments parsing, for now Spek
    understands only `--help` and `--version` (in addition to the usual
    gtk+ and gst options.)
-   Open the file passed as an argument. In the future Spek will also
    associate itself with common audio formats so that you could use it
    as a viewer.
-   Fix a crash when the window width is very small.
