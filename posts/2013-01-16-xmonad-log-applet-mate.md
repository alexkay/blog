Title: xmonad-log-applet 2.1.0 released, with MATE support
Tags: xla, xmonad, gnome

I've just released a new version of [xmonad-log-applet][]. Thanks to
[Ari Croock][] it now works with the [MATE][] desktop environment, just include
`--with-panel=mate` when configuring the applet.

Because GitHub recently disabled new downloads, the tarballs are now hosted on
[Google Code][].

I also added a [new tag][] for the applet in case you want to follow just x-l-a
related posts.
