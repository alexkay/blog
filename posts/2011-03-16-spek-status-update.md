Title: Spek status update
Tags: gnome, spek

Just a quick update on the status of [the project][].

Spek is now translatable, the next version will feature at least these
translations: Dutch, German, Russian, Swedish and Ukrainian. We use
[Transifex][] to manage translations. Feel free to translate it into your
language or to improve an existing translation. Transifex is a very easy to use
tool, you don't have to know anything about programming to translate.

Some progress has been made on the packaging front, Spek packages are now
available in [Arch Linux][], [FreeBSD][] and [Gentoo][] repositories.

I also created a package for Debian which needs a sponsor. If you are a Debian
Developer I would appreciate a review and eventually an upload.  The package can
be found on [mentors.debian.net][].

Last but not least, the next version will show some OS X love. Many OS X
specific bugs have already been fixed or are scheduled to be fixed for the next
release.

I expect to release Spek 0.7 sometime this spring. If you are feeling
adventurous, try Spek from [git master][], compilation instructions are on
[the wiki][].
