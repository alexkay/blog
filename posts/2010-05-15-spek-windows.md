Title: Spek 0.2 - now works in Windows
Tags: spek, gnome

[Spek][] now has a fully functional Windows port! The installer bundles
GTK+, GStreamer and all their dependencies, you don't need to install
anything else.

I also moved project hosting over to Google Code so Spek now has a
full-fledged [bug tracker][]. The source code is still hosted on
[Gitorious][].

If you are tired of starting up monstrous applications like Adobe
Audition or Audacity just to check a file's spectrogram, [give Spek a
shot][]!
