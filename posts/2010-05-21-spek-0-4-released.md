This version brings the following features and and improvements:

-   Associate with audio files ("Open with..." menu in file managers.)
-   Show the name of the open file in the window title.
-   Support 24-bit FLACs.
-   Drag and Drop support.
-   Show file name and its properties in the window.

Grab Spek 0.4 while it's hot, the source code tarball and the Windows
installer can be downloaded [here][].

A special "thank you" to users of a popular private tracker, their great
suggestions helped to shape this release.
