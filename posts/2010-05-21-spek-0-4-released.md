Title: Spek 0.4 Released
Tags: gnome, spek

I've just released version 0.4 of [Spek][] -- an acoustic spectrum analyser for
GNU/Linux and Windows.

![Spek showing a 24-bit FLAC file][sshot]{: .center }

This version brings the following features and improvements:

* Associate with audio files ("Open with..." menu in file managers.)
* Show the name of the open file in the window title.
* Support 24-bit FLACs.
* Drag and Drop support.
* Show file name and its properties in the window.

Grab Spek 0.4 while it's hot, the source code tarball and the Windows installer
can be downloaded [here][].

A special "thank you" to users of a popular private tracker, their great
suggestions helped to shape this release.

P.S. Hello, Planet GNOME! :)
