<p><strong>Thumbtack, Inc. (San Francisco, CA)</strong><br>May 2012 -- present: Software engineer (full-time, permanent)</p>
<p><a href="http://thumbtack.com/"><code class="url">http://thumbtack.com/</code></a></p>
<p>TBD</p>
<p><strong>RMG Technology (M) Sdn Bhd (Cyberjaya, Malaysia)</strong><br>Nov 2010 -- May 2012: Senior software engineer (full-time, permanent)</p>
<p><a href="http://betonmarkets.com/"><code class="url">http://betonmarkets.com/</code></a></p>
<p>RMG Technology is a subsidiary of the Regent Markets Group which runs <a href="http://betonmarkets.com/">BetOnMarkets</a>
 -- the leading financial betting service. Offered bets are in effect 
exotic binary options on currencies, indices, commodities and stocks; 
ranging from time horizons of a few minutes to one year.</p>
<p>I was initially hired to support and further develop the website's 
back end systems, however after a few months I transitioned to the quant
 team to work on new option pricing engines and to support the 
quant-related infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our team implemented models varying from vanilla Black-Scholes to 
Vanna-Volga to LV, SV and SLV. My part in the project was implementation
 of a Monte-Carlo pricer running on GPUs (using CUDA and OpenCL) as well
 as improvement of model calibration routines and their integration into
 the pricing engine.</p>
<p>I worked in a mixed Linux/FreeBSD/Windows environment with wide variety of languages: C++, CUDA/OpenCL C, Perl, R and VBA.</p>

<p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soon after joining the company I migrated its version control 
infrastructure from SVN to Git. Because the team used branches so 
extensively, the switch allowed to dramatically reduce the merge time 
and eliminated most errors caused by merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Quickly picked up mathematics after ten years of having little 
exposure to it. Learned stochastic calculus and its applications in 
finance. Used this knowledge to review research papers and turn their 
ideas into code.</li>
<li>Implemented a pricer based on Monte-Carlo simulations running on 
GPUs. This significantly speeds up simulations and makes MC-based 
engines practical for the company.</li>

<p><strong>Pluritech CVBA (Vilvoorde, Belgium; Sydney, Australia)</strong><br>Sep 2005 -- Oct 2010: Senior developer (full-time, contract, telecommuting from Sydney)<br>Jan 2002 -- Aug 2005: Senior developer (full-time, permanent)</p>
<p><a href="http://pluritech.com/"><code class="url">http://pluritech.com/</code></a></p>
<p>Pluritech is a fast-growing IT solutions provider located near 
Brussels. My role in the company was to lead its software development 
team. I was involved in all stages of the SDLC, from liaising projects 
with clients and designing solutions that would suit them best, to 
implementation and deployment.</p>
<p>Most projects I delivered were n-tier client-server applications with
 client component implemented using Windows Forms, business logic layer 
written using ADO.NET, and with Microsoft SQL Server as a back-end. The 
client component connected to the business logic component via a secure 
HTTPS channel implemented using .NET Remoting technology. Many projects 
also included a Windows Service component performing various background 
tasks, such as sending out e-mails, replicating data with off-site 
databases and processing scheduled tasks.</p>
<p>Pluritech's clients I worked with include:</p>
<ul>
<li>European Union Committees and Associations:
<ul>
<li>COPA and COGECA: <a href="http://www.copa-cogeca.be/"><code class="url">http://www.copa-cogeca.be/</code></a></li>

<li>Merifin Capital: <a href="http://www.merifin.com/"><code class="url">http://www.merifin.com/</code></a> -- an investment group</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brought to the company the expertise it needed, transforming it from
 primarily a hardware reseller and IT support provider to a complete 
solutions provider with equally large hardware and software departments.</li>
<li>Successfully led our small but scattered development team. During my
 employment we had developers working from the main office in Belgium, 
and telecommuting from Australia, France, Russia and Czech Republic.</li>
<li>Designed PluriWorks -- Pluritech’s flagship product, and implemented most of its 100K+ lines of C#, T-SQL and C++ code.</li>
<li>Migrated legacy applications written in VB6 and Access to .NET and SQL Server.</li>
<li>Actively supported existing systems written by 3rd parties in Visual Basic, PHP, Perl and Python.</li>
<li>Learned that it’s not the technical expertise that matters, but the value it can give the client.</li>

<p><strong>Capvidia NV (Leuven, Belgium)</strong><br>Dec 2000 -- Dec 2001: Software engineer (full-time, permanent)</p>
<p><strong>Capvidia NN (Nizhny Novgorod, Russia)</strong><br>Jul 2000 -- Nov 2000: Programmer (full-time, permanent)<br>Sep 1998 -- Jul 2000: Junior programmer (full-time, permanent)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.capvidia.com/"><code class="url">http://www.capvidia.com/</code></a></p>
<p>Capvidia is a global software development company with offices in 
Belgium, United States, Japan and Russia. It specialises in CAD and GIS 
applications and is a SolidWorks Certified Gold Partner.</p>
<p>I started working at Capvidia after receiving my Bachelor’s degree. 
My first project was implementation of a C++ library of common graph 
theory data structures and algorithms. The library was used by the 
company’s GIS applications.</p>
<p>After the project was successfully completed, I was asked to develop a
 COM/VBA interface to the architectural CAD application the company was 
doing for a client. The interface allowed 3rd party companies to write 
add-ins on top of our application. The project quickly expanded; a year 
later I was leading a team of 2-3 developers and trainees.</p>

<p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed and with help of other team members implemented complete COM API for a large-scale architectural CAD application.</li>
<li>Trained and provided support to 3rd party add-in developers.</li>
<li>Provided technical assistance and led a small development team.</li>
<li>Quickly progressed from graduate to senior-level position.</li>
<li>Learned that close interaction with clients is the key to successful software projects.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Science</strong></p>
<p>May 1995 -- Aug 1998: Junior research fellow (part-time, contract)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ipfran.ru/"><code class="url">http://www.ipfran.ru/</code></a></p>
<p>Institute of Applied Physics is one of the leading research centres 
in Russia. It specialises in non-linear dynamics and optics, plasma 
physics and hydrophysics.</p>
<p>I worked on an application that controlled the optical coherent 
tomograph designed by the institute. The tomograph performed 
non-invasive penetration scans and had mostly medical applications. 
Apart from controlling the tomograph, the program also had a module that
 converted tomograph’s output to popular image formats, applied various 
filters to the images and performed data analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a complete solution to work with the tomograph which 
helped to show its full capabilities and resulted in subsequent research
 grants provided to the institute.</li>
<li>Applied theoretical mathematics and computer science knowledge gained in the university.</li>
<li>Learned how to write real-world software.</li>
