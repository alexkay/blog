Title: Improved Last.fm import in muspy
Tags: muspy

[muspy][] is a free / open-source album release notification service.

To make it easier to populate the list of artists you want to follow, muspy
allows to import top artists from your Last.fm account. Today this function
became more flexible: in addition to getting overall top artists, it can now
import most frequently listened artists in the last 12, 6 and 3 months and 1
week.

![Import from Last.fm][import]{: .center }

I also lifted the limit on the number of artists that can be imported from 200
to 500, and increased the number selected by default from 50 to 100.

Do you have a feature that you want to see in muspy? [Let me know][contact]!
Alternatively, feel free to fork muspy on [GitHub][] and to send your pull
requests.

If you are a music lover and never tried muspy before, [give it a go][muspy]!
With muspy you will not miss an album release ever again.
