Title: Improved Last.fm import in muspy
Author: Alexander Kojevnikov
Tags: muspy

[muspy][] is a free / open-source album release notification service.

</p>

To make it easier to populate the list of artists you want to follow,
muspy allows to import top artists from your Last.fm account. Today this
function became more flexible: in addition to getting overall top
artists, it can now import most frequently listened artists in the last
12, 6 and 3 months and 1 week.

I also lifted the limit on the number of artists that can be imported
from 200 to 500, and increased the number selected by default from 50 to
100.

</p>

Do you have a feature that you want to see in muspy? [Let me know][]!
Alternatively, feel free to fork muspy on [GitHub][] and to send your
pull requests.

If you are a music lover and never tried muspy before, [give it a
go][muspy]! With muspy you will not miss an album release ever again.
