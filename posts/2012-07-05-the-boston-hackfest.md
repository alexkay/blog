Title: The Boston Hackfest
Tags: banshee, gnome

The [GNOME and Mono Festival of Love][festival] was a blast! I finally met
[Bertrand][] and [Aaron][] -- my fellow Banshee co-maintainers; as well as a lot
of GNOME and Mono people. I also met [Udesh][], the SoC student I'm mentoring
this year, who is working on voice control in Banshee.

I reviewed and committed a bunch of (mostly long overdue) patches in Banshee and
taglib-sharp, and released a new version of the latter. We also discussed with
Udesh his project and went through some technicalities.

I want to thank [David][] for organising the event, GNOME Foundation for
covering my plane tickets and our sponsors for making it happen:
