Title: muspy API
Tags: muspy

[![muspy][]][][muspy][1] is a website that notifies you when your
favourite artists release new albums. muspy is free software released
under GNU AGPL.

Today I'm happy to announce the availability of the [muspy API][]. The
API allows you to create and modify user accounts, to manage the list of
artists you want to follow and to receive their releases.

Someone is already working on an iPhone app that will use the API,
expect more news on this front soon!
