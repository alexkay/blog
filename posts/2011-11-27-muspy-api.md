Tags: muspy

![muspy logo][logo]{: .right }
[muspy][] is a website that notifies you when your favourite artists release new
albums. muspy is free software released under GNU AGPL.

Today I'm happy to announce the availability of the [muspy API][api]. The API
allows you to create and modify user accounts, to manage the list of artists you
want to follow and to receive their releases.

Someone is already working on an iPhone app that will use the API, expect more
news on this front soon!
