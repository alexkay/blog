Title: Spek 0.6 Released
Tags: spek, gnome

I'm happy to announce the release of [Spek 0.6][] â€“ a multi-platform
acoustic spectrum analyser.

This version is about 3 times faster than 0.5 thanks to the
lightning-fast [FFmpeg decoders][] and the new multi-threaded analysis
algorithm.

Spek 0.6 also features dramatically reduced size of the Windows
installer (from 17.1 MiB to 9.8 MiB) and OS X bundle (from 10.5 MiB to
6.1 MiB)

Read the [NEWS][] file for a complete change log.
